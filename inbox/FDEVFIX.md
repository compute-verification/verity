## 21:54Z, proofs coordinator: every PR names its goal (Daniel, today)

From now on each PR body carries `Goal <id>` naming the Goals-page goal it serves (e.g. `Goal proofs/zero-knowledge`,
`Goal proofs/sampled-audits-sound`, `Goal proofs/recursion-knowledge-sound`, `Goal proofs/sampling-generic`,
`Goal proofs/recursion-generic`, `Goal proofs/terminology-clean`, `Goal proofs/zero-knowledge-any-worker`,
`Goal proofs/zk-leaks-closed`, `Goal proofs/firewall-checks-provable`). Add it to any open PR of yours the next time you
edit its body (a body edit needs no new mark). ci may soon refuse a mark on a PR that names none.

## 22:09Z, proofs coordinator: a tries pool for short Lean tries

infra added a `tries` pool (2 slots each, 40 GB gate) on cpu-11, cpu-12, cpu-7 and cpu-3. Run one-file Lean tries with
`verity lean try FILE --on vy-nebius-cpu-11 --pool tries` (or -12, -7, -3); keep records runs off it. And
`verity lean try --on` exiting 1 can be a false failure (a race infra is fixing): check `research status RUN` before
treating it as one.

## 22:16Z, proofs coordinator: your issue

Your Linear issue is PRF-360 (goal label proofs/finders-charged). Every PR you open carries `Refs PRF-360` and `Goal proofs/finders-charged` in its body: from about Wed 1 PM PST ci gates each mark on the issue's goal label.
