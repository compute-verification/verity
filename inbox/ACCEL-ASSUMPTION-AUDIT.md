## 26 Oct 02:55Z, from the coordinator: BET-COVERAGE's result (note compute-research/20261026T0136Z-draft-accel-bet-coverage; branch cursor/compute-research-accel-bet-coverage-ea24 at 114ce998dd)

- **The bet is alive, on projection.** The best coverage at γ ≤ 10 without a new claim is **about 73%** of the frozen shape's static INT8 MACs on one H200. This is a model projection, not a measurement. The design is v5/v6 (J10-R, per-call noise) on 32×32 units at full K, run as one stream, with the noised weight W′ = B + c + U formed once per call (a kernel-only change). v5/v6 as built projects to 65%. The one compute-bound H200 measurement (an older, unsound J10-R kernel) gives about 50%.
- **Hashing isn't the limit.** SHA-512 costs 5.70e-6 compressions per credited MAC (1.2 H200 MAC-times). The binding cost is the units' integer work, the fold and the B unpack, at **16.5 MAC-times per MAC**.
- **Killed by hashing:** per-unit noise (at most 25%), the pinned v1 tile (0.4%), operand rows committed per tile, and single lane-chunk draws (under 40%).
- **Higher coverage needs Daniel.** Folding at L = 64 reaches 94–100% but needs a **new ReceiptLuckAt claim**. **The li fold rests on KLI₂₄, an empirical premise. That's a defect under R-ACCEL-4.**
- **Proving is the real constraint.** ε < 1% needs 3,857 sampling blocks a period (δ = 1%) or 11,571 (10⁻⁶). That is 3,628 or 10,883 process-days of proving a period, scaled from one card's model, or about 518 processes for a week. Chunking units at K = 4,096 cuts it 5.6× and costs 14 points of coverage.
- **Gaps for M3 (compute-accounting's).** `h1zy` has no J10-R lanes, so a full-K v5/v6 unit (6e9 ANDs) can't be proved inside C-Flock's 2^27 limit. A verifier `range` equal to the workload's unit count would reveal the batch size M; it should be a fixed, padded 2^27 with filler units and a public bound on ρ.
- **A smell for PROTO-DESIGN.** Its "100% at γ ≤ 10" rests on the machine model, not measured units. Measured units run at 0.45 of BET-COVERAGE's floor, which is already 1.4× the machine model's figure.

**For you:** Add KLI₂₄ (li's empirical premise) as a defect, and the L = 64 ReceiptLuckAt variant as a claim that would need Daniel.

## 26 Oct 03:02Z, from the coordinator: R-ACCEL-5, proving cost is not a constraint
Daniel (25 Oct 7:06 PM PDT): "don't worry about proving, I know for a fact that won't be the actual constraint in deployment."
- Drop proving cost from scoring and from every limit.
- Never trade coverage, ε or γ for proving cost. For example, don't chunk units smaller just to prove faster.
- γ means the honest serving overhead only.
- You may still report proving cost as information.

## 26 Oct 02:20Z, from the coordinator: the target end state is agreed with Daniel (brief section 0, new)
- Read `briefs/accel-program.md` section 0. It holds the trust base, the guarantee, **the adversary resource model (the world's compute: about 9.4e30 FP8 FLOP a year, about 1.8e29 a week)** and the targets: ε ≤ 1% at δ = 10⁻⁶, γ ≤ 10, coverage ≥ 95% of all matmul MACs, perplexity < 5% for now (optimized last), and proving cost not a constraint.
- State every figure against the world model, for a week, a month and a year. A datacenter or single-card figure goes beside it, never instead of it.
