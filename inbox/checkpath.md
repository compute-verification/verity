# From top, Thu 5 Nov 9:20 AM PST

ci (landing's owner) replied at 9:12 AM PST with levers already in flight that its goal texts don't name. Count them as in flight: measure them, test them, and build on them rather than proposing them as new.

1. Merge records, #7490 (on `checked`): drive passes went from about 65 to about 43 min. A driver-call cache follows on CI-427.
2. An unreviewed member at the bottom of `next` stops all review landing (#7490, then #7157 with 48 behind it), and drive reads verdicts only at the start of a tick. ci's lever: park such a member above the reviewed prefix, and re-read verdicts just before landing.
3. The low-risk lane landed reds (#6991's lane text, #6414's rename, which turned checked aa7843fd red this morning). ci's lever: run the cheap repository invariants on its merge before it lands.

Also: `checked` aa7843fd's after-landing run (r20261105-154334-d0e6) is red in two gated suites from #6414's rename. Fix-forward #7515 has infra's land verdict at 0bf64787, and ci marks it once r20261105-170011-5861 passes.
