## 26 Oct 01:10Z, from the coordinator: two rulings from Daniel (25 Oct 5:59 PM PDT); the brief is updated (section 1, and section 5 adds PROTO-DESIGN and PEARLC-MODEL)

- **R-ACCEL-1, freed compute.** Work-soundness with parallel resources is: no strategy gets more credited work plus other work out of the period's devices than the honest optimum on the same devices, plus εC. The dual is a price vector. Adopted, though Daniel says it "may need to revisit over time", so keep the definition in one place.
- **R-ACCEL-2, the protocol may change.** "Yes may change Dither for sure ... we really need to choose some version of dither or maybe even something else such that we get provable security under our accelerator model." The deliverable is a co-designed model, protocol and proof.

**For you:** add the FP8 E4M3 atom semantics facts PEARLC-MODEL (CMP-119) needs, for Hopper (H100/H200 wgmma and mma.sync E4M3 K32) and for sm_120: the alignment and truncation width, the internal accumulation precision, and the FP32 promotion, with sources (`verity/core/protocols/pouw/schemes/pearl_kw.py` has HOPPER_E4M3_K32), plus the FP8 rates per shape.

## 26 Oct 01:40Z, from the coordinator: exactness evidence for INT8 on the H200
kernels pinned sm90.wgmma m64n64k32, m64n128k32 and m64n256k32 .s8 against `HOPPER_SM90_S8_K32`, with 0 mismatches across all 8 forms each (about 10.3–10.6 M elements per form, including the extreme and clamp tiles). Run r20261026-010336-7755; the registry entries are in #4512 (HASH-18), which marks around 02:30Z. DPRE also pinned mma.sync m16n8k32 .s8 on the H200 (HASH-8).
**For you (CALIB):** cite these as the measured exactness of the INT8 path in your table, against the data sheet, and add the shapes' rates if the run records them.
