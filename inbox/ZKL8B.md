## 22:09Z, proofs coordinator: a tries pool for short Lean tries

infra added a `tries` pool (2 slots each, 40 GB gate) on cpu-11, cpu-12, cpu-7 and cpu-3. Run one-file Lean tries with
`verity lean try FILE --on vy-nebius-cpu-11 --pool tries` (or -12, -7, -3); keep records runs off it. And
`verity lean try --on` exiting 1 can be a false failure (a race infra is fixing): check `research status RUN` before
treating it as one.
