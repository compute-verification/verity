## 26 Oct 01:10Z, from the coordinator: two rulings from Daniel (25 Oct 5:59 PM PDT); the brief is updated (section 1, and section 5 adds PROTO-DESIGN and PEARLC-MODEL)

- **R-ACCEL-1, freed compute.** Work-soundness with parallel resources is: no strategy gets more credited work plus other work out of the period's devices than the honest optimum on the same devices, plus εC. The dual is a price vector. Adopted, though Daniel says it "may need to revisit over time", so keep the definition in one place.
- **R-ACCEL-2, the protocol may change.** "Yes may change Dither for sure ... we really need to choose some version of dither or maybe even something else such that we get provable security under our accelerator model." The deliverable is a co-designed model, protocol and proof.

**For you:** no change to your task. Note in your paper whether the result also holds for bit-exact FP8 matmul (Pearl-C), where rounding already breaks Strassen's exactness.

## 26 Oct 01:42Z, from the coordinator: avoid "Activity task timed out"
Two ACCEL workers (O-IO and O-CHARGE) died 30–40 min into their first turn with "Activity task timed out", before pushing or writing a note, so their work was lost. Do these:
- **If you haven't yet,** write and sync your note now, even if it only holds your plan and findings so far, and sync it again at every result.
- **Keep every tool call short** (well under 10 min).
- **Read big files in slices.**
- **Push your branch early.**
- **End your turn** rather than run one very long step.

## 26 Oct 02:22Z, from the coordinator: LIT's survey (note compute-research/20261026T0104Z-draft-accel-lit; CMP-117)

- **No literature result gives Theorem O.**
  - Rank bounds are quadratic (Bläser, Landsberg), and Efremenko–Garg–Oliveira–Wigderson cap what rank methods can reach.
  - ⟨n,32,n⟩ has bilinear schemes at about 0.24 of naive (Hopcroft–Kerr, tensored).
  - Restated in bilinear form, Theorem K says the matrix decoding products into words has at least n³ nonzeros. P2 makes each nonzero a priced delivery.
- **Shared partial sums threaten that charge.**
  - Four Russians tables on the binary R at A = B = 0 deliver mod-2 rank 8 per lookup, which breaks 4(d)'s "rank ≤ 1 per word fed".
  - LIT estimates about 2 (RTX PRO 6000) or 8 (H200) MAC-times per unit of rank, plus ALU work beyond duo's. That is above honest on both cards, but the margin on the RTX PRO 6000 is thin.
  - Charge each delivery by the rank it carries: G1 bounds table storage, and G2 prices the shared-memory gathers.
  - Protocol lever: a non-periodic S removes the table reuse.
- **I/O and cut arguments can't give n³ alone.** Information crossing is capped by the transcript's entropy (at most n²+7nL bits). What scales is the transcript's volume, n³/L words written to registers. So the leverage is at register-file writes and shared-memory gathers.
- **No proof of useful work is proved.** KSW's Assumption 6.4 and Pearl FP8's Assumption 1 are conjectures.
  - Proofs of work proved in a physical cost model fix the computation graph with a random oracle, then apply pebbling.
  - The template is Blocki–Ren–Zhou: a random oracle, then red-blue pebbling, then energy as a weighted sum of resources.
  - If any route needs SHA-512 as a random oracle, that goes beyond the stated trust base and is a claims question for Daniel. Flag it to the coordinator.
- **CRT (Ozaki Scheme II)** makes wide products cost linear in width, not ⌈w/8⌉².
  - LIT estimates CRT Strassen below naive near n ≈ 2^20 if ALU work is ignored.
  - On the H200 the ALU price keeps it above naive; on the RTX PRO 6000 only device memory does.
- **Miller (1975)** is the only n³ lower bound for matmul in a restricted model, and it comes from a rounding (stability) requirement.
- **FP8 semantics:** Hopper accumulates one group of 32 at width 14, and sm_120 one group of 32 at width 26. Both match the repository's pins.
- **Device-specific overhead (brief 4(e), now fixed):** the 1.47–1.55× plain INT8 is the RTX PRO 6000's. On the H200, data-sheet arithmetic predicts duo's ALU work at about 6× tensor time, so γ ≈ 5.

**For you:** Include the CRT (Ozaki II) path in the exact-path costs, since it makes wide products linear in width. Your crossover n must account for it. Say whether ALU or memory then decides on each card.

## 26 Oct 02:40Z, from the coordinator: two more rulings from Daniel (25 Oct 7:00 PM PDT); brief section 1 updated

- **R-ACCEL-4.** "It's very crucial to have the only assumptions be the parameters of the accelerator model. Let's make this work and invest heavily in it if need be."
  - The trust base is the model's parameters θ, standard crypto, and live coins from the auditor's devices.
  - Every other premise is a defect to remove: FOLD-OPT, FILL-OPT, ABSORB, H-μ⁺'s cancellation premise, 𝒦, ChargeVF3j16, the per-word premise and TT_OUT.
  - A theorem-to-be slot inside the model is fine. A premise about algorithms never is.
  - ASSUMPTION-AUDIT keeps the burn-down list. Send any premise you introduce or find to the coordinator, and say which class it's in.
- **R-ACCEL-3.** On SHA-512 as a random oracle, Daniel: "I could see this being potentially reasonable."
  - You may use the random-oracle model for SHA-512, but only as an explicitly named assumption.
  - Say which results use it; Daniel confirms each one that depends on it.
  - Prefer collision resistance where it suffices.
- **New workers:** ASSUMPTION-AUDIT, FOLD-SAT (SMT superoptimization lower bounds for fold steps over the exact ISA) and ABSORB-THM (the absorption cost per word, proved in the model).

## 26 Oct 03:02Z, from the coordinator: R-ACCEL-5, proving cost is not a constraint
Daniel (25 Oct 7:06 PM PDT): "don't worry about proving, I know for a fact that won't be the actual constraint in deployment."
- Drop proving cost from scoring and from every limit.
- Never trade coverage, ε or γ for proving cost. For example, don't chunk units smaller just to prove faster.
- γ means the honest serving overhead only.
- You may still report proving cost as information.

## 26 Oct 02:20Z, from the coordinator: the target end state is agreed with Daniel (brief section 0, new)
- Read `briefs/accel-program.md` section 0. It holds the trust base, the guarantee, **the adversary resource model (the world's compute: about 9.4e30 FP8 FLOP a year, about 1.8e29 a week)** and the targets: ε ≤ 1% at δ = 10⁻⁶, γ ≤ 10, coverage ≥ 95% of all matmul MACs, perplexity < 5% for now (optimized last), and proving cost not a constraint.
- State every figure against the world model, for a week, a month and a year. A datacenter or single-card figure goes beside it, never instead of it.
