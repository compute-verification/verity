## 26 Oct 01:10Z, from the coordinator: two rulings from Daniel (25 Oct 5:59 PM PDT); the brief is updated (section 1, and section 5 adds PROTO-DESIGN and PEARLC-MODEL)

- **R-ACCEL-1, freed compute.** Work-soundness with parallel resources is: no strategy gets more credited work plus other work out of the period's devices than the honest optimum on the same devices, plus εC. The dual is a price vector. Adopted, though Daniel says it "may need to revisit over time", so keep the definition in one place.
- **R-ACCEL-2, the protocol may change.** "Yes may change Dither for sure ... we really need to choose some version of dither or maybe even something else such that we get provable security under our accelerator model." The deliverable is a co-designed model, protocol and proof.

**For you:** no change to your task. Make sure P1 covers FP8 E4M3 tensor-core atoms (Hopper's E4M3 K32 atom with its alignment truncation, in `pearl_kw.py`, and sm_120's) as well as INT8 and BF16, since PEARLC-MODEL (CMP-119) will instantiate the model at Pearl-C.

## 26 Oct 01:40Z, from the coordinator: exactness evidence for INT8 on the H200
kernels pinned sm90.wgmma m64n64k32, m64n128k32 and m64n256k32 .s8 against `HOPPER_SM90_S8_K32`, with 0 mismatches across all 8 forms each (about 10.3–10.6 M elements per form, including the extreme and clamp tiles). Run r20261026-010336-7755; the registry entries are in #4512 (HASH-18), which marks around 02:30Z. DPRE also pinned mma.sync m16n8k32 .s8 on the H200 (HASH-8).
**For you (MODEL-SPEC):** P1's INT8 exact domain on the H200 instance can cite this evidence. Name the pinned semantics (`HOPPER_SM90_S8_K32`), not a prose claim.

## 26 Oct 01:42Z, from the coordinator: avoid "Activity task timed out"
Two ACCEL workers (O-IO and O-CHARGE) died 30–40 min into their first turn with "Activity task timed out", before pushing or writing a note, so their work was lost. Do these:
- **If you haven't yet,** write and sync your note now, even if it only holds your plan and findings so far, and sync it again at every result.
- **Keep every tool call short** (well under 10 min).
- **Read big files in slices.**
- **Push your branch early.**
- **End your turn** rather than run one very long step.

## 26 Oct 01:55Z, from the coordinator: O-REDTEAM's first findings (note compute-research/20261026T0124Z-draft-accel-o-redteam; branch cursor/compute-research-accel-o-redteam-ea24 at 248ae56ed8, `benchmarks/pouw/theory/accel_redteam.py`)
1. **The model has no issue slot. This is fatal to section 2 as drafted, and it needs a model fix, not a protocol fix.** The pipes in R sum to more than twice the H200's 128 lane-instructions per SM per clock. b1, which has no data-sheet tensor rate, and the uniform datapath cost zero on every listed resource, so AND.POPC and uniform work are free in a literal reading of section 2. The data-sheet machine already has `[issue]` (A2, documented) and `[uniform_issue]` (A2u, measured only). No concrete attack exploits it yet; the spare-FFMA-pipe route fails on a sign wall, checked exactly.
2. **FOLD-OPT and FILL-OPT are algorithmic assumptions on the honest side. They are fatal to ε unless the fold's minimum is proved in the model.** The H200 headline design (`dither-1s-li-l32.toml`) rests ε_mand = 0 on "LI is the cheapest fold", and ε is hypersensitive to it: a fold 0.058% cheaper takes DS-90 to 1%. No proof route (O-CHARGE, O-BITS, O-IO) covers the fold, because they bound producing the transcript, not absorbing it. BET-FOLD (CMP-128) is now on it.
3. **Exact CPU checks, all passing:**
   - b1 is exact but 15× honest (ALU-bound);
   - depth-1 Strassen reproduces every word at 7/8 of the tensor work but 4× honest on the ALU;
   - IMAD packing of the exact word needs slots of at least 13 bits (at least 22× honest);
   - the FFMA sign wall holds.
   The honest kernel is balanced at 1/128 (census JI90_0).
**For you (MODEL-SPEC), before your 08:00Z statement:** add the issue resource (warp-instruction issue slots per SM per clock, shared by every pipe) and the uniform-issue resource, as TS/Sheet does, so every instruction costs at least its issue slots. Then no instruction, b1 and uniform included, is free on every resource. Count them as physical facts (scheduler issue width).

## 26 Oct 02:40Z, from the coordinator: two more rulings from Daniel (25 Oct 7:00 PM PDT); brief section 1 updated

- **R-ACCEL-4.** "It's very crucial to have the only assumptions be the parameters of the accelerator model. Let's make this work and invest heavily in it if need be."
  - The trust base is the model's parameters θ, standard crypto, and live coins from the auditor's devices.
  - Every other premise is a defect to remove: FOLD-OPT, FILL-OPT, ABSORB, H-μ⁺'s cancellation premise, 𝒦, ChargeVF3j16, the per-word premise and TT_OUT.
  - A theorem-to-be slot inside the model is fine. A premise about algorithms never is.
  - ASSUMPTION-AUDIT keeps the burn-down list. Send any premise you introduce or find to the coordinator, and say which class it's in.
- **R-ACCEL-3.** On SHA-512 as a random oracle, Daniel: "I could see this being potentially reasonable."
  - You may use the random-oracle model for SHA-512, but only as an explicitly named assumption.
  - Say which results use it; Daniel confirms each one that depends on it.
  - Prefer collision resistance where it suffices.
- **New workers:** ASSUMPTION-AUDIT, FOLD-SAT (SMT superoptimization lower bounds for fold steps over the exact ISA) and ABSORB-THM (the absorption cost per word, proved in the model).

## 26 Oct 03:02Z, from the coordinator: R-ACCEL-5, proving cost is not a constraint
Daniel (25 Oct 7:06 PM PDT): "don't worry about proving, I know for a fact that won't be the actual constraint in deployment."
- Drop proving cost from scoring and from every limit.
- Never trade coverage, ε or γ for proving cost. For example, don't chunk units smaller just to prove faster.
- γ means the honest serving overhead only.
- You may still report proving cost as information.

## 26 Oct 02:20Z, from the coordinator: the target end state is agreed with Daniel (brief section 0, new)
- Read `briefs/accel-program.md` section 0. It holds the trust base, the guarantee, **the adversary resource model (the world's compute: about 9.4e30 FP8 FLOP a year, about 1.8e29 a week)** and the targets: ε ≤ 1% at δ = 10⁻⁶, γ ≤ 10, coverage ≥ 95% of all matmul MACs, perplexity < 5% for now (optimized last), and proving cost not a constraint.
- State every figure against the world model, for a week, a month and a year. A datacenter or single-card figure goes beside it, never instead of it.

## 26 Oct 03:00Z, from the coordinator: the barrier, an open decision with Daniel (ABSORB-THM, note compute-research/20261026T0215Z-draft-accel-absorb-thm; O-BITS, note compute-research/20261026T0152Z-draft-accel-o-bits)

- **Theorem B (ABSORB-THM; O-BITS agrees).** The instruction set contains LOP3, which computes any 3-input Boolean function. So a proved bound of "work ≥ c·n³" (or r per absorbed word) for computing Dither's transcript from (A, B, σ), over the full instruction set, would be an explicit superlinear Boolean circuit lower bound, beyond every known technique. This hits Theorem O, O-CHARGE, ABSORB and FOLD-OPT alike.
- **What is provable from the model's parameters alone:**
  - output and word counting: O-BITS shows every non-ring instruction costs at least the k32 INT8 tensor core's time per word on the H200, but in aggregate over parallel units 4(g) gives c ≈ 0.333 on the H200 and about 0.11–0.14 on sm_120;
  - costs when the words are given as inputs (ABSORB-THM's Theorem D: r ≈ 1/766 SM-clock per word, about 5.3 INT8 MAC-times, 0.17 of LI's honest cost);
  - ring-fragment counts (BET-K-DISCHARGE).
- **The random oracle doesn't rescue it cheaply** (Theorem B′): one SHA-512 compression forces at most 48 words, so a hybrid costs γ ≳ 4300/L, about 134 at L = 32.
- **The decision with Daniel** (asked 03:00Z):
  - **(A)** one named computational assumption, as narrow as possible (e.g. "bit-level tricks on coin-dependent data don't beat the ring fragment"), with the same standing as SHA-512's collision resistance: stated, cryptanalyzed by BET-ALGO-LAB and O-REDTEAM, with ε_alg measured;
  - **(B)** SHA-512 per word as a random oracle, at γ ≈ 134–223;
  - **(C)** credit only the provable floor (c ≈ 1/3 on the H200), so ε ≈ 0 on what's credited but coverage is about 1/3;
  - **(D)** keep searching for a protocol that sidesteps it. The barrier applies to any explicit function, so none is in sight.
  - The coordinator recommends (A) with (C)'s floor stated beside it as the unconditional part.
- **Until Daniel answers:** keep going. Under (A) and (C) alike, what you prove (the ring fragment, counting floors, words-as-inputs bounds, folds, lucks) is the unconditional part. Under (A), the assumption should be the weakest one your route needs, so say what that is in your note.
- **Linear identity:** cloud workers' Linear comments show "Daniel Reuter" as author (O-BITS's finding), so readers may take them as Daniel's words. **Start every Linear comment with `[ACCEL <NAME>]`** (or your worker name).

## 26 Oct 03:00Z, from the coordinator
FOLD-SAT (CMP-131) reports that your `Isa.lean` at 738a30c30f has no LEA.HI or IMAD.HI, so honest duo is priced at 4 instructions instead of 3. Add both under R4's coverage table. FOLD-SAT's SMT models cover every integer instruction in your Isa.lean but not FP32; align the semantics where they differ.

## 26 Oct 03:08Z, from the coordinator: register with the agent watch (infra's request)
The agent watch finds cloud workers through the `origin:` field of their notes. Put this exact line in your note's front matter and keep it there:
`origin: ACCEL MODEL-SPEC, bc-8e07fa19-b949-54d8-bd2e-c07b670e5cc2, launched by compute-research bc-ebc09a9a-ce64-52b5-b3b6-2c8862c7e9ac; code cursor/compute-research-accel-model-spec-ea24`
Then sync. Without it, nobody hears when your `research run`s end.

## 26 Oct 03:35Z, from the coordinator: R-ACCEL-6, the computational assumption is scoped to matmul (Daniel, 25 Oct 7:37 PM PDT)

- **The ruling.** Daniel: "I'm most happy with scoping this down to matmuls because these are so closely studied. If we make this public algorithmic knowledge thing for every single algorithm, that just feels way weaker because a lot of these are completely unstudied." The single computational premise (symmetric algorithmic knowledge, SAK) covers only **exact matrix products**: no program computes them on the card more cheaply, per priced unit, than the best public matmul algorithm.
  - That includes the segment products and prefix sums of a product.
  - It includes computing all but a small fraction of a product's entries correctly. Matmul's random self-reducibility makes that no easier.
  - Everything on the tensor core and in ring arithmetic is still proved.
- **Consequence 1: nothing else can lean on SAK.** The receipt, the fold, ABSORB and the lucks are not matmuls, so they must be **provable** (from θ, standard crypto and live coins) or designed away.
- **Consequence 2: a receipt without a fold** (the coordinator's proposal; PROTO-DESIGN is checking it). Commit every word with SHA-512 (a Merkle tree, collision resistance only) and drop the fold.
  - Hashing costs γ_hash ≈ 6460/L on the H200; noise removal costs γ_rm ≈ L/K.
  - At L in the thousands (L ≤ K), both are small. At K = 16384: L = 8192 gives about 0.79 + 0.5. At K = 65536: L = 16384 gives about 0.39 + 0.25.
  - Binding is then collision resistance plus sampling luck (Theorem S). The receipt-side defects (FOLD-OPT, ABSORB, ReceiptLuckAt, GuessLuckAt, H-μ⁺) disappear.
  - What remains about hashing is its speed. An adversary with a faster SHA-512 frees part of honest's hashing time, so SHA-512's implementation speed is a second closely studied algorithm. It goes to Daniel to confirm.
- **HYB** (BET-HYBRID-2; note compute-research/20261026T0225Z-draft-accel-bet-hybrid-2; branch cursor/compute-research-accel-bet-hybrid-ea24 at 58cc8a6a9f) is H1 with three changes:
  - U widened to ±96;
  - activation-side noise V of ±64;
  - 8-bit data on both sides, with sparse mod-2⁸ wrap corrections.

  The served product is exactly H1's. INT8 overflow stays at 11.3% or more for two-term and 26.2% or more for four-term sums at every admissible A, B, so P1 alone blocks Strassen with no data escape. Each word's F₂ rank is 64. γ ≈ 1.03 on data-sheet rates, and real-weight wrap densities are being measured.

## 26 Oct 03:55Z, from the coordinator: R-ACCEL-7 (Daniel, 7:46 PM PDT)
SHA-512 implementation speed is the second "public best" premise, beside SAK(matmul): nobody computes SHA-512 meaningfully faster than the best public implementation. That allows the no-fold design (a SHA-512 commitment of every word at large L). The adversary model's figures are reconciled in the brief's section 1: 9.36e30 FLOP a year is the Sept 2027 rate (the base grown about 4.9×), and it is the figure of record.
