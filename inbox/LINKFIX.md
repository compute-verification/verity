## 21:54Z, proofs coordinator: every PR names its goal (Daniel, today)

From now on each PR body carries `Goal <id>` naming the Goals-page goal it serves (e.g. `Goal proofs/zero-knowledge`,
`Goal proofs/sampled-audits-sound`, `Goal proofs/recursion-knowledge-sound`, `Goal proofs/sampling-generic`,
`Goal proofs/recursion-generic`, `Goal proofs/terminology-clean`, `Goal proofs/zero-knowledge-any-worker`,
`Goal proofs/zk-leaks-closed`, `Goal proofs/firewall-checks-provable`). Add it to any open PR of yours the next time you
edit its body (a body edit needs no new mark). ci may soon refuse a mark on a PR that names none.

## 22:09Z, proofs coordinator: a tries pool for short Lean tries

infra added a `tries` pool (2 slots each, 40 GB gate) on cpu-11, cpu-12, cpu-7 and cpu-3. Run one-file Lean tries with
`verity lean try FILE --on vy-nebius-cpu-11 --pool tries` (or -12, -7, -3); keep records runs off it. And
`verity lean try --on` exiting 1 can be a false failure (a race infra is fixing): check `research status RUN` before
treating it as one.

## 22:16Z, proofs coordinator: your issue

Your Linear issue is PRF-360 (goal label proofs/finders-charged). Every PR you open carries `Refs PRF-360` and `Goal proofs/finders-charged` in its body: from about Wed 1 PM PST ci gates each mark on the issue's goal label.

## 23:17Z, proofs coordinator: pins.py --merged runs Lean builds locally

`pins.py --merged` runs pinned fixtures' generators, which `lake build` on your VM, and nothing refuses it yet (ci CI-383,
hook refusal Wed). Until then, run it only through `research run --on auto`, or recompute pins by hashing.

## 00:53Z, proofs coordinator: check shape.inline before every mark (until LEAN-172)

lean found that something run AFTER a merge (pins.py --merged, check.py --update, or committing a records run's lock)
can drop `shape.inline` entries from a lean-audit.json: #6676 lost 22 that way, and #6075's committed record may have too.
Until lean's fix (LEAN-172) lands: before marking, diff each lock's `shape.inline` against the merge driver's output for
your merge (`python3 tools/verity/lean/merge.py`) and against next's. Restore any entry whose premise the merged tree still
takes inline, as a normal commit, and say so in the PR body.

## 01:24Z, proofs coordinator: the repository suite fails on next itself

`next` alone fails seven `repository` tests (tools/research's environment reads, the writing-goals skill's retired terms,
lint baselines; ci holds #7035, #7049, #6899 for the lane-text lint). If your suites run fails only in `repository`, compare
the failing test ids against next's own (run the repository suite on next's tip, or read ZKD3's #7175 body, which lists
them). Identical set: not yours; say so in the PR body and proceed. Anything extra: fix it.
