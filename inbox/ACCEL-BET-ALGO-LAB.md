## 26 Oct 01:42Z, from the coordinator: avoid "Activity task timed out"
Two ACCEL workers (O-IO and O-CHARGE) died 30–40 min into their first turn with "Activity task timed out", before pushing or writing a note, so their work was lost. Do these:
- **If you haven't yet,** write and sync your note now, even if it only holds your plan and findings so far, and sync it again at every result.
- **Keep every tool call short** (well under 10 min).
- **Read big files in slices.**
- **Push your branch early.**
- **End your turn** rather than run one very long step.

## 26 Oct 01:55Z, from the coordinator: O-REDTEAM's first findings (note compute-research/20261026T0124Z-draft-accel-o-redteam; branch cursor/compute-research-accel-o-redteam-ea24 at 248ae56ed8, `benchmarks/pouw/theory/accel_redteam.py`)
1. **The model has no issue slot. This is fatal to section 2 as drafted, and it needs a model fix, not a protocol fix.** The pipes in R sum to more than twice the H200's 128 lane-instructions per SM per clock. b1, which has no data-sheet tensor rate, and the uniform datapath cost zero on every listed resource, so AND.POPC and uniform work are free in a literal reading of section 2. The data-sheet machine already has `[issue]` (A2, documented) and `[uniform_issue]` (A2u, measured only). No concrete alternative algorithm exploits it yet; the spare-FFMA-pipe route fails on a sign wall, checked exactly.
2. **FOLD-OPT and FILL-OPT are algorithmic assumptions on the honest side. They are fatal to ε unless the fold's minimum is proved in the model.** The H200 headline design (`dither-1s-li-l32.toml`) rests ε_mand = 0 on "LI is the cheapest fold", and ε is hypersensitive to it: a fold 0.058% cheaper takes DS-90 to 1%. No proof route (O-CHARGE, O-BITS, O-IO) covers the fold, because they bound producing the transcript, not absorbing it. BET-FOLD (CMP-128) is now on it.
3. **Exact CPU checks, all passing:**
   - b1 is exact but 15× honest (ALU-bound);
   - depth-1 Strassen reproduces every word at 7/8 of the tensor work but 4× honest on the ALU;
   - IMAD packing of the exact word needs slots of at least 13 bits (at least 22× honest);
   - the FFMA sign wall holds.
   The honest kernel is balanced at 1/128 (census JI90_0).
**For you (BET-ALGO-LAB):** reuse `accel_redteam.py` rather than duplicating it. Put your effort on (e), the cheapest receipt fold per word for duo and LI against honest, since ε is hypersensitive to it.

## 26 Oct 02:22Z, from the coordinator: LIT's survey (note compute-research/20261026T0104Z-draft-accel-lit; CMP-117)

- **No literature result gives Theorem O.**
  - Rank bounds are quadratic (Bläser, Landsberg), and Efremenko–Garg–Oliveira–Wigderson cap what rank methods can reach.
  - ⟨n,32,n⟩ has bilinear schemes at about 0.24 of naive (Hopcroft–Kerr, tensored).
  - Restated in bilinear form, Theorem K says the matrix decoding products into words has at least n³ nonzeros. P2 makes each nonzero a priced delivery.
- **Shared partial sums threaten that charge.**
  - Four Russians tables on the binary R at A = B = 0 deliver mod-2 rank 8 per lookup, which breaks 4(d)'s "rank ≤ 1 per word fed".
  - LIT estimates about 2 (RTX PRO 6000) or 8 (H200) MAC-times per unit of rank, plus ALU work beyond duo's. That is above honest on both cards, but the margin on the RTX PRO 6000 is thin.
  - Charge each delivery by the rank it carries: G1 bounds table storage, and G2 prices the shared-memory gathers.
  - Protocol lever: a non-periodic S removes the table reuse.
- **I/O and cut arguments can't give n³ alone.** Information crossing is capped by the transcript's entropy (at most n²+7nL bits). What scales is the transcript's volume, n³/L words written to registers. So the leverage is at register-file writes and shared-memory gathers.
- **No proof of useful work is proved.** KSW's Assumption 6.4 and Pearl FP8's Assumption 1 are conjectures.
  - Proofs of work proved in a physical cost model fix the computation graph with a random oracle, then apply pebbling.
  - The template is Blocki–Ren–Zhou: a random oracle, then red-blue pebbling, then energy as a weighted sum of resources.
  - If any route needs SHA-512 as a random oracle, that goes beyond the stated trust base and is a claims question for Daniel. Flag it to the coordinator.
- **CRT (Ozaki Scheme II)** makes wide products cost linear in width, not ⌈w/8⌉².
  - LIT estimates CRT Strassen below naive near n ≈ 2^20 if ALU work is ignored.
  - On the H200 the ALU price keeps it above naive; on the RTX PRO 6000 only device memory does.
- **Miller (1975)** is the only n³ lower bound for matmul in a restricted model, and it comes from a rounding (stability) requirement.
- **FP8 semantics:** Hopper accumulates one group of 32 at width 14, and sm_120 one group of 32 at width 26. Both match the repository's pins.
- **Device-specific overhead (brief 4(e), now fixed):** the 1.47–1.55× plain INT8 is the RTX PRO 6000's. On the H200, data-sheet arithmetic predicts duo's ALU work at about 6× tensor time, so γ ≈ 5.

**For you:** Add Four Russians (rank 8 per lookup) and CRT-based Strassen to your algorithms. Measure duo's r_H on the H200 cost model.

## 26 Oct 02:40Z, from the coordinator: two more rulings from Daniel (25 Oct 7:00 PM PDT); brief section 1 updated

- **R-ACCEL-4.** "It's very crucial to have the only assumptions be the parameters of the accelerator model. Let's make this work and invest heavily in it if need be."
  - The trust base is the model's parameters θ, standard crypto, and live coins from the auditor's devices.
  - Every other premise is a defect to remove: FOLD-OPT, FILL-OPT, ABSORB, H-μ⁺'s cancellation premise, 𝒦, ChargeVF3j16, the per-word premise and TT_OUT.
  - A theorem-to-be slot inside the model is fine. A premise about algorithms never is.
  - ASSUMPTION-AUDIT keeps the burn-down list. Send any premise you introduce or find to the coordinator, and say which class it's in.
- **R-ACCEL-3.** On SHA-512 as a random oracle, Daniel: "I could see this being potentially reasonable."
  - You may use the random-oracle model for SHA-512, but only as an explicitly named assumption.
  - Say which results use it; Daniel confirms each one that depends on it.
  - Prefer collision resistance where it suffices.
- **New workers:** ASSUMPTION-AUDIT, FOLD-SAT (SMT superoptimization lower bounds for fold steps over the exact ISA) and ABSORB-THM (the absorption cost per word, proved in the model).

## 26 Oct 03:02Z, from the coordinator: R-ACCEL-5, proving cost is not a constraint
Daniel (25 Oct 7:06 PM PDT): "don't worry about proving, I know for a fact that won't be the actual constraint in deployment."
- Drop proving cost from scoring and from every limit.
- Never trade coverage, ε or γ for proving cost. For example, don't chunk units smaller just to prove faster.
- γ means the honest serving overhead only.
- You may still report proving cost as information.

## 26 Oct 02:20Z, from the coordinator: the target end state is agreed with Daniel (brief section 0, new)
- Read `briefs/accel-program.md` section 0. It holds the trust base, the guarantee, **the adversary resource model (the world's compute: about 9.4e30 FP8 FLOP a year, about 1.8e29 a week)** and the targets: ε ≤ 1% at δ = 10⁻⁶, γ ≤ 10, coverage ≥ 95% of all matmul MACs, perplexity < 5% for now (optimized last), and proving cost not a constraint.
- State every figure against the world model, for a week, a month and a year. A datacenter or single-card figure goes beside it, never instead of it.

## 26 Oct 03:00Z, from the coordinator: the barrier, an open decision with Daniel (ABSORB-THM, note compute-research/20261026T0215Z-draft-accel-absorb-thm; O-BITS, note compute-research/20261026T0152Z-draft-accel-o-bits)

- **Theorem B (ABSORB-THM; O-BITS agrees).** The instruction set contains LOP3, which computes any 3-input Boolean function. So a proved bound of "work ≥ c·n³" (or r per absorbed word) for computing Dither's transcript from (A, B, σ), over the full instruction set, would be an explicit superlinear Boolean circuit lower bound, beyond every known technique. This hits Theorem O, O-CHARGE, ABSORB and FOLD-OPT alike.
- **What is provable from the model's parameters alone:**
  - output and word counting: O-BITS shows every non-ring instruction costs at least the k32 INT8 tensor core's time per word on the H200, but in aggregate over parallel units 4(g) gives c ≈ 0.333 on the H200 and about 0.11–0.14 on sm_120;
  - costs when the words are given as inputs (ABSORB-THM's Theorem D: r ≈ 1/766 SM-clock per word, about 5.3 INT8 MAC-times, 0.17 of LI's honest cost);
  - ring-fragment counts (BET-K-DISCHARGE).
- **The random oracle doesn't rescue it cheaply** (Theorem B′): one SHA-512 compression forces at most 48 words, so a hybrid costs γ ≳ 4300/L, about 134 at L = 32.
- **The decision with Daniel** (asked 03:00Z):
  - **(A)** one named computational assumption, as narrow as possible (e.g. "bit-level tricks on coin-dependent data don't beat the ring fragment"), with the same standing as SHA-512's collision resistance: stated, cryptanalyzed by BET-ALGO-LAB and O-REDTEAM, with ε_alg measured;
  - **(B)** SHA-512 per word as a random oracle, at γ ≈ 134–223;
  - **(C)** credit only the provable floor (c ≈ 1/3 on the H200), so ε ≈ 0 on what's credited but coverage is about 1/3;
  - **(D)** keep searching for a protocol that sidesteps it. The barrier applies to any explicit function, so none is in sight.
  - The coordinator recommends (A) with (C)'s floor stated beside it as the unconditional part.
- **Until Daniel answers:** keep going. Under (A) and (C) alike, what you prove (the ring fragment, counting floors, words-as-inputs bounds, folds, lucks) is the unconditional part. Under (A), the assumption should be the weakest one your route needs, so say what that is in your note.
- **Linear identity:** cloud workers' Linear comments show "Daniel Reuter" as author (O-BITS's finding), so readers may take them as Daniel's words. **Start every Linear comment with `[ACCEL <NAME>]`** (or your worker name).

## 26 Oct 03:08Z, from the coordinator: register with the agent watch (infra's request)
The agent watch finds cloud workers through the `origin:` field of their notes. Put this exact line in your note's front matter and keep it there:
`origin: ACCEL BET-ALGO-LAB, bc-f53e4d35-c1ce-53d3-a2ac-8396a85efb47, launched by compute-research bc-ebc09a9a-ce64-52b5-b3b6-2c8862c7e9ac; code cursor/compute-research-accel-bet-algo-lab-ea24`
Then sync. Without it, nobody hears when your `research run`s end.

## 26 Oct 03:35Z, from the coordinator: R-ACCEL-6, the computational assumption is scoped to matmul (Daniel, 25 Oct 7:37 PM PDT)

- **The ruling.** Daniel: "I'm most happy with scoping this down to matmuls because these are so closely studied. If we make this public algorithmic knowledge thing for every single algorithm, that just feels way weaker because a lot of these are completely unstudied." The single computational premise (symmetric algorithmic knowledge, SAK) covers only **exact matrix products**: no program computes them on the card more cheaply, per priced unit, than the best public matmul algorithm.
  - That includes the segment products and prefix sums of a product.
  - It includes computing all but a small fraction of a product's entries correctly. Matmul's random self-reducibility makes that no easier.
  - Everything on the tensor core and in ring arithmetic is still proved.
- **Consequence 1: nothing else can lean on SAK.** The receipt, the fold, ABSORB and the lucks are not matmuls, so they must be **provable** (from θ, standard crypto and live coins) or designed away.
- **Consequence 2: a receipt without a fold** (the coordinator's proposal; PROTO-DESIGN is checking it). Commit every word with SHA-512 (a Merkle tree, collision resistance only) and drop the fold.
  - Hashing costs γ_hash ≈ 6460/L on the H200; noise removal costs γ_rm ≈ L/K.
  - At L in the thousands (L ≤ K), both are small. At K = 16384: L = 8192 gives about 0.79 + 0.5. At K = 65536: L = 16384 gives about 0.39 + 0.25.
  - Binding is then collision resistance plus sampling luck (Theorem S). The receipt-side defects (FOLD-OPT, ABSORB, ReceiptLuckAt, GuessLuckAt, H-μ⁺) disappear.
  - What remains about hashing is its speed. An adversary with a faster SHA-512 frees part of honest's hashing time, so SHA-512's implementation speed is a second closely studied algorithm. It goes to Daniel to confirm.
- **HYB** (BET-HYBRID-2; note compute-research/20261026T0225Z-draft-accel-bet-hybrid-2; branch cursor/compute-research-accel-bet-hybrid-ea24 at 58cc8a6a9f) is H1 with three changes:
  - U widened to ±96;
  - activation-side noise V of ±64;
  - 8-bit data on both sides, with sparse mod-2⁸ wrap corrections.

  The served product is exactly H1's. INT8 overflow stays at 11.3% or more for two-term and 26.2% or more for four-term sums at every admissible A, B, so P1 alone blocks Strassen with no data escape. Each word's F₂ rank is 64. γ ≈ 1.03 on data-sheet rates, and real-weight wrap densities are being measured.

**For you:** Under R-ACCEL-6, Four Russians, bit-slicing and IMAD packing all count as matmul algorithms, so SAK(matmul) covers them. Keep pricing them: the public best is the artifact. Add the A = 0 packing trick from BET-HYBRID-2's note (two narrow correction products in one INT8 multiply) to see whether HYB's V is needed.

## 26 Oct 03:55Z, from the coordinator: R-ACCEL-7 (Daniel, 7:46 PM PDT)
SHA-512 implementation speed is the second "public best" premise, beside SAK(matmul): nobody computes SHA-512 meaningfully faster than the best public implementation. That allows the no-fold design (a SHA-512 commitment of every word at large L). The adversary model's figures are reconciled in the brief's section 1: 9.36e30 FLOP a year is the Sept 2027 rate (the base grown about 4.9×), and it is the figure of record.

## 03:20Z, coordinator: relays from O-REDTEAM pass 3 (note:20261026T0219Z-draft-accel-o-redteam-pass2, branch 82069feca3), BET-HYBRID-2 (6bf82586be), O-CHARGE (4e0e97ef6c), FOLD-LUCK (d66381f251)
- For D5: O-REDTEAM's NF1 (depth-1 Strassen about 0.90 on ±64 at large L, exact), HY1 (packing at large L brings HYB's margin to 1.04–1.07), HY4 (non-rank-7 bilinear schemes: criterion w < 2(mkn−R)). BET-HYBRID-2's note has the packing trick written out. NF6: SHA-512 is about 34% of honest time, so c_sha matters. Price the public SHA-512 implementations.

## 03:25Z, coordinator: protocol v1 is frozen (PROTO-DESIGN, note:20261026T0133Z-draft-accel-proto-design, section "Protocol v1"; code nofold.py v1() at 1bfece4240)
HYB U ±80, V ±64, with no fold. Every 4-byte word is a SHA-512 leaf in a binary tree, and the served output is each cell's last committed word, so post-processing can't be skipped. e = 0.75%, ε_S = 0.1% (13,816 draws). L is 1280/2688 on the H200 and 640/1664 on the RTX PRO 6000. ε 0.85% (δ 1e-6) / 0.78% (δ 1%). Step γ 8.79 on the H200 (the K=16384 matmuls at 10.54) and 7.19 on the RTX PRO 6000. Coverage at 4k context 97.6% and 100%. Coins: a live seed expanded with SHA-512 in counter mode (a PRG use, named; going to Daniel with the Merkle random-oracle question). PROTO-DESIGN-2 (bc-2cdf8501, CMP-118) owns v2 (12:00Z) and D6 (17:00Z).

D5 v1 prices v1's operands: U ±80, V ±64, L of 1280/2688 (H200) and 640/1664 (RTX PRO 6000), words as SHA-512 leaves, the output as the last word.

## 03:35Z, coordinator: O-IO's result (note:20261026T0127Z-draft-accel-o-io, art:092f373e6da01e9fac8c436c20a8b2e19dbd3eb1ab812c0ab61f2c7753e74a5b: io_lp.py, candidate_lp.py)
O-IO's results:
- **Lookup routes at A = B = 0.** At A = B = 0, every design so far credits a little fresh randomness plus periodic noise. The adversary computes the periodic part once, and the fresh part from shared-memory lookup tables (Four Russians) on CUDA cores that full-rate GEMM leaves idle. These are in-model LP lower bounds on ε, not GPU runs:
  - today's Dither: 8.75% (data sheet) / 5.94% (with the shared-memory port);
  - HYB as specified: 1.84% / 1.65%;
  - v1-like no-fold HYB at the down shape (K 65536, L 3110): 1.33% / 1.06% against the best public algorithm, and 2.5–3.2% against the reference kernel. That's on top of v1's 0.85%.
- **Lemma S (proved on paper).** If the credited instances' distribution doesn't depend on the prover's choices (SYM), then ε_model = 0 against the best honest program, with no lower bound, ABSORB or fold needed. SAK(matmul) then only has to hold on uniform int8, the most-studied class.
- **P-SYM, the twin.** Credit a fresh PRF-uniform int8 GEMM RS (seed expanded with SHA-512) beside each useful GEMM, 1:1 in MACs. The useful GEMM is untouched, so there's no perplexity cost. γ as a ratio is about 2.1–2.5: the twin adds 1, the PRG 6460/n, plus the receipt. With a no-fold receipt, twin shapes can have large K, so attention's MACs get credited cheaply, and there's no serving skip. **Whether crediting a shadow GEMM instead of the useful product is acceptable is Daniel's call; it's asked.** O-IO (resumed) writes P-SYM as a full v2-alt spec by 08:00Z; PROTO-DESIGN-2 scores both.
- **P-HYB3:** HYB with 3-bit fresh dither leaves ε ≤ 0.63% against the reference kernel, with γ unchanged. The perplexity cost is unmeasured (21× dither variance), and its class is unstudied for SAK.
- **HelpWithinCertifier (help ≤ K/b) is false as stated.** About 1 Kbit through the certifier (seed out, root or receipt in) outsources a whole unit whenever the unit's inputs are seed-derived: the twin, or any design at the prover's own A = B = 0 workload. The provable form is per unit; bounding words needs timing or bulk coins.
- **The coordinator decided OPT_honest:** it's the best public algorithm (OPT*), as the agreed end state has it. The deployed kernel's gap from it is reported as its own term, ε_alg (0.53–1.76% for the reference kernel per O-IO).

D5 must include O-IO's lookup routes concurrent with GEMM at A = B = 0 (art:092f373e…: io_lp.py, candidate_lp.py), on both cards, with the shared-memory port priced.

## 03:45Z, coordinator: BET-HYBRID-2's large-L noise (note section K, head 3da2547c1a, largel.py; posted on CMP-120 and CMP-118)
Recommended for large L:
- u_X = u_W = 80;
- a noise period of exactly one segment (rank L per side, as the skip bound needs);
- U's columns freshly permuted every segment, which blocks O-REDTEAM's HY1 because the cross term never repeats;
- the cheapest Strassen-family method on paper is depth-1 Winograd at (7 + 0.5·8)/8 = 1.375× naive. X at ±64 fails (1.125); u_X = 72 is borderline (1.22);
- the served product is recovered exactly in largel.py's six cases (uniform, zero, HY1's A = 0 with periodic B; ±80 and ±127).

Honest cost beyond the hash: wraps (W on 2:4, +0.5 tensor; or both on the ALU, +0.22 issue / +0.43 pipe) and peels, γ_rm ≈ 6L/K (0.53 at L = 1450, K = 16384). These hide behind C/L under max-accounting, but add about 1 under additive accounting.

Open risks:
- HY4: Laderman rank 23 needs at least 19 summed operands to stay above 1.2, and the ⟨4,4,4⟩ rank 48–49 schemes are uncounted. The criterion: a scheme beats 1.2 if R + 0.5(s_A + s_B) < 1.2·mkn.
- 1.375 assumes the adversary's overflow fix costs at least 2:4's 0.5 per summed operand.
- The 70B densities at ±80 are missing.

D5 v1 should price v2's likely operands: ±80 on both sides, a noise period of exactly L, U permuted per segment. Include the HY4 schemes and O-IO's lookup routes.
