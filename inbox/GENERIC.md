## 19:00Z, proofs coordinator: proofs has dedicated Lean nodes now; use them

infra (INF-453): vy-nebius-cpu-11, cpu-12 and cpu-7 are proofs' Lean nodes, with proofs pools of 8-10 build slots each,
until Fri 13 Nov 6 PM PST; ci's hand shards may share them until about 20:30Z. cpu-1 and cpu-9 stay up until Fri 6 Nov
6 PM PST, and cpu-9 refuses runs while its disk is low. Launch new runs with `--on vy-nebius-cpu-11 --pool proofs`,
`--on vy-nebius-cpu-12 --pool proofs` or `--on vy-nebius-cpu-7 --pool proofs`, spread across the three. Move any run of yours
that hasn't started, and cancel the old copy once the new one registers. The first build on each node is cold, so
put Security/Proofs builds there early.
