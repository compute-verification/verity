## 03:25Z, coordinator: protocol v1 is frozen (PROTO-DESIGN, note:20261026T0133Z-draft-accel-proto-design, section "Protocol v1"; code nofold.py v1() at 1bfece4240)
HYB U ±80, V ±64, with no fold. Every 4-byte word is a SHA-512 leaf in a binary tree, and the served output is each cell's last committed word, so post-processing can't be skipped. e = 0.75%, ε_S = 0.1% (13,816 draws). L is 1280/2688 on the H200 and 640/1664 on the RTX PRO 6000. ε 0.85% (δ 1e-6) / 0.78% (δ 1%). Step γ 8.79 on the H200 (the K=16384 matmuls at 10.54) and 7.19 on the RTX PRO 6000. Coverage at 4k context 97.6% and 100%. Coins: a live seed expanded with SHA-512 in counter mode (a PRG use, named; going to Daniel with the Merkle random-oracle question). PROTO-DESIGN-2 (bc-2cdf8501, CMP-118) owns v2 (12:00Z) and D6 (17:00Z).

v1 is frozen: attack it at U ±80, V ±64 and L of 1280–2688 (H200) and 640–1664 (RTX PRO 6000). HY1's packing at large L is the first thing to count exactly at these L.

## 03:35Z, coordinator: O-IO's result (note:20261026T0127Z-draft-accel-o-io, art:092f373e6da01e9fac8c436c20a8b2e19dbd3eb1ab812c0ab61f2c7753e74a5b: io_lp.py, candidate_lp.py)
O-IO's results:
- **Lookup routes at A = B = 0.** At A = B = 0, every design so far credits a little fresh randomness plus periodic noise. The adversary computes the periodic part once, and the fresh part from shared-memory lookup tables (Four Russians) on CUDA cores that full-rate GEMM leaves idle. These are in-model LP lower bounds on ε, not GPU runs:
  - today's Dither: 8.75% (data sheet) / 5.94% (with the shared-memory port);
  - HYB as specified: 1.84% / 1.65%;
  - v1-like no-fold HYB at the down shape (K 65536, L 3110): 1.33% / 1.06% against the best public algorithm, and 2.5–3.2% against the reference kernel. That's on top of v1's 0.85%.
- **Lemma S (proved on paper).** If the credited instances' distribution doesn't depend on the prover's choices (SYM), then ε_model = 0 against the best honest program, with no lower bound, ABSORB or fold needed. SAK(matmul) then only has to hold on uniform int8, the most-studied class.
- **P-SYM, the twin.** Credit a fresh PRF-uniform int8 GEMM RS (seed expanded with SHA-512) beside each useful GEMM, 1:1 in MACs. The useful GEMM is untouched, so there's no perplexity cost. γ as a ratio is about 2.1–2.5: the twin adds 1, the PRG 6460/n, plus the receipt. With a no-fold receipt, twin shapes can have large K, so attention's MACs get credited cheaply, and there's no serving skip. **Whether crediting a shadow GEMM instead of the useful product is acceptable is Daniel's call; it's asked.** O-IO (resumed) writes P-SYM as a full v2-alt spec by 08:00Z; PROTO-DESIGN-2 scores both.
- **P-HYB3:** HYB with 3-bit fresh dither leaves ε ≤ 0.63% against the reference kernel, with γ unchanged. The perplexity cost is unmeasured (21× dither variance), and its class is unstudied for SAK.
- **HelpWithinCertifier (help ≤ K/b) is false as stated.** About 1 Kbit through the certifier (seed out, root or receipt in) outsources a whole unit whenever the unit's inputs are seed-derived: the twin, or any design at the prover's own A = B = 0 workload. The provable form is per unit; bounding words needs timing or bulk coins.
- **The coordinator decided OPT_honest:** it's the best public algorithm (OPT*), as the agreed end state has it. The deployed kernel's gap from it is reported as its own term, ε_alg (0.53–1.76% for the reference kernel per O-IO).

O-IO's lookup routes (Four Russians from shared-memory tables, on CUDA cores concurrent with GEMM, at A = B = 0) are in its art (io_lp.py, candidate_lp.py). Check its counts, including the shared-memory port at 128 B a SM-clock, and run them on v1's exact operands. Its own smell: the 1.06% doesn't survive a 2× count error.

## 03:45Z, coordinator: BET-HYBRID-2's large-L noise (note section K, head 3da2547c1a, largel.py; posted on CMP-120 and CMP-118)
Recommended for large L:
- u_X = u_W = 80;
- a noise period of exactly one segment (rank L per side, as the skip bound needs);
- U's columns freshly permuted every segment, which blocks O-REDTEAM's HY1 because the cross term never repeats;
- the cheapest Strassen-family method on paper is depth-1 Winograd at (7 + 0.5·8)/8 = 1.375× naive. X at ±64 fails (1.125); u_X = 72 is borderline (1.22);
- the served product is recovered exactly in largel.py's six cases (uniform, zero, HY1's A = 0 with periodic B; ±80 and ±127).

Honest cost beyond the hash: wraps (W on 2:4, +0.5 tensor; or both on the ALU, +0.22 issue / +0.43 pipe) and peels, γ_rm ≈ 6L/K (0.53 at L = 1450, K = 16384). These hide behind C/L under max-accounting, but add about 1 under additive accounting.

Open risks:
- HY4: Laderman rank 23 needs at least 19 summed operands to stay above 1.2, and the ⟨4,4,4⟩ rank 48–49 schemes are uncounted. The criterion: a scheme beats 1.2 if R + 0.5(s_A + s_B) < 1.2·mkn.
- 1.375 assumes the adversary's overflow fix costs at least 2:4's 0.5 per summed operand.
- The 70B densities at ±80 are missing.

Your HY4 count is now the main risk to this design's 1.2 bar: count summed operands per side (s_A, s_B) for Laderman, Hopcroft–Kerr and the rank 48–49 ⟨4,4,4⟩ schemes. Then check O-IO's lookup routes at A = B = 0 against the per-segment permutation: do shared-memory tables over U's rows survive a fresh permutation each segment?
