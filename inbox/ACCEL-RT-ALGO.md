## 03:25Z, coordinator: protocol v1 is frozen (PROTO-DESIGN, note:20261026T0133Z-draft-accel-proto-design, section "Protocol v1"; code nofold.py v1() at 1bfece4240)
HYB U ±80, V ±64, with no fold. Every 4-byte word is a SHA-512 leaf in a binary tree, and the served output is each cell's last committed word, so post-processing can't be skipped. e = 0.75%, ε_S = 0.1% (13,816 draws). L is 1280/2688 on the H200 and 640/1664 on the RTX PRO 6000. ε 0.85% (δ 1e-6) / 0.78% (δ 1%). Step γ 8.79 on the H200 (the K=16384 matmuls at 10.54) and 7.19 on the RTX PRO 6000. Coverage at 4k context 97.6% and 100%. Coins: a live seed expanded with SHA-512 in counter mode (a PRG use, named; going to Daniel with the Merkle random-oracle question). PROTO-DESIGN-2 (bc-2cdf8501, CMP-118) owns v2 (12:00Z) and D6 (17:00Z).

v1 is frozen: attack it at U ±80, V ±64 and L of 1280–2688 (H200) and 640–1664 (RTX PRO 6000). HY1's packing at large L is the first thing to count exactly at these L.
