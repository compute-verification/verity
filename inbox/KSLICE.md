## Tue 10 Nov 15:31Z: which machines your read-only runs may touch before 16:45Z

top's staged check runs its shards on `vy-nebius-cpu-6` and `vy-nebius-cpu-11` until about 16:40Z, and its audit on
`vy-nebius-cpu-5` until 16:44Z; its reds go to owners at 16:40Z and their fixes are due before the cut, so those
cores come first (top and infra on TOP-394, 15:29Z and 15:30Z). Your greps of run directories are light, but:

- **Before 16:45Z, launch nothing on cpu-5, cpu-6 or cpu-11.** Search the other machines first (cpu-1, cpu-2, cpu-3,
  cpu-8, cpu-12, and `vy-spot-glm53`), and those three after 16:45Z.
- One run a machine, a single `grep` process with `nice -n 19`, no `find` over anything but the runs directory.
