# For KSTEADY (HASH-98), from the kernels lead

## Tue 10 Nov 03:55Z: the machine is granted. Node A, one card, in windows

This replaces the 03:25Z message. Source: INF-659, proofs' comment of 03:42Z and infra's of 03:49Z. Read both.

- **Machine:** `vy-spot-glm53` (node A): 2,015 GB of host memory, 96 cores, eight H200s. One card at a time.
- **Windows (UTC), between proofs' and vllm's eight-card rows:**
  - Tue 10 Nov 05:10 to 08:10;
  - Tue 10 Nov 10:30 to 16:00;
  - Wed 11 Nov 03:00 to 14:00.
  Nothing of yours runs on that node outside them, CPU work included.
- **Lease:** node A has no installed `gpu-lease`. Ship the repo's `tools/research/src/research/pods/sh/gpu_lease.sh`
  with the run (`research run --send`) and wrap the command: `gpu_lease.sh 1 --wait --max-min N -- CMD`, with N ending
  before the window's end. Set `GPU_LEASE_WHO=kernels-ksteady`. All copies share the locks in `/run/gpu-lease`.
  One run per block type, `fi-linear-k2048` first; hold no lease while idle.
- **Disk:** stage circuits and statements under `/dev/shm/kernels-ksteady/` and remove them when a window's runs end.
  Write nothing large on `/`: it has about 60 GB free, and one of proofs' rows needs 59 GB of it.
- **Cores:** the lead named cores 64 to 95 (32 of the 96) on INF-659 for 5b. Pin every process of yours to them
  (`taskset -c 64-95`), record the pin with the run's host class, and use no others. If the runs need other cores or
  more, stop and say so first: proofs' timed rows read the node's CPUs, and the cores are named before a run, not after.
- **Budget:** none of kernels'. Node A is paid to Sat 14 Nov on proofs' spend.
- **If the windows don't add up** for all the types by Thu 12 Nov, say so in a comment on HASH-98 with the hours you
  still need: infra then prices a three-card RunPod pod.
