Daniel (6:05 PM PDT, via top): kernels has started the sm_90a build of `PouwH1Tile_v5/v6` (per-call noise, J10-R) with KCOMMIT-FB: the recompile, the SASS gate and the exactness gates, on vy-dc-h200 (not the demo card). Whether M3's credit cites it is still Daniel's decision. Treat v5/v6 on the H200 as the near-term baseline row: get its SHA-512 compressions per credited MAC from the J10-R code (`benchmarks/hash/dither`, h1u), and say what coverage it reaches at γ ≤ 10. When kernels posts measured numbers, I'll relay them.

## 26 Oct 01:35Z, from the coordinator: URGENT, do the v5/v6 row first
Daniel (6:17 PM PDT, via top): the per-call-noise tile `PouwH1Tile_v5/v6` (J10-R) is Demo A's PoUW, on M2–M3's critical path (CMP-126). top: "BET-COVERAGE's (CMP-124) v5/v6 row is this leg's input, so do that row first." Before anything else, compute the v5/v6 row for the frozen shape on the H200, with the verifier's range covering every static INT8 matmul of the sampling block:
- coverage (share of the step's static MACs);
- γ, including SHA-512 compressions per credited MAC at 4.79 G/s;
- commit bytes per sampling block;
- the proof unit's size against C-Flock's limit.

Post the row as a comment on **both CMP-124 and CMP-126** as soon as you have it, even rough, with the assumptions stated, and aim for 03:00Z. compute-accounting builds the block's PoUW leg from it. Then continue with the rest of your table.

## 26 Oct 01:42Z, from the coordinator: avoid "Activity task timed out"
Two ACCEL workers (O-IO and O-CHARGE) died 30–40 min into their first turn with "Activity task timed out", before pushing or writing a note, so their work was lost. Do these:
- **If you haven't yet,** write and sync your note now, even if it only holds your plan and findings so far, and sync it again at every result.
- **Keep every tool call short** (well under 10 min).
- **Read big files in slices.**
- **Push your branch early.**
- **End your turn** rather than run one very long step.

## 26 Oct 02:22Z, from the coordinator: LIT's survey (note compute-research/20261026T0104Z-draft-accel-lit; CMP-117)

- **No literature result gives Theorem O.**
  - Rank bounds are quadratic (Bläser, Landsberg), and Efremenko–Garg–Oliveira–Wigderson cap what rank methods can reach.
  - ⟨n,32,n⟩ has bilinear schemes at about 0.24 of naive (Hopcroft–Kerr, tensored).
  - Restated in bilinear form, Theorem K says the matrix decoding products into words has at least n³ nonzeros. P2 makes each nonzero a priced delivery.
- **Shared partial sums threaten that charge.**
  - Four Russians tables on the binary R at A = B = 0 deliver mod-2 rank 8 per lookup, which breaks 4(d)'s "rank ≤ 1 per word fed".
  - LIT estimates about 2 (RTX PRO 6000) or 8 (H200) MAC-times per unit of rank, plus ALU work beyond duo's. That is above honest on both cards, but the margin on the RTX PRO 6000 is thin.
  - Charge each delivery by the rank it carries: G1 bounds table storage, and G2 prices the shared-memory gathers.
  - Protocol lever: a non-periodic S removes the table reuse.
- **I/O and cut arguments can't give n³ alone.** Information crossing is capped by the transcript's entropy (at most n²+7nL bits). What scales is the transcript's volume, n³/L words written to registers. So the leverage is at register-file writes and shared-memory gathers.
- **No proof of useful work is proved.** KSW's Assumption 6.4 and Pearl FP8's Assumption 1 are conjectures.
  - Proofs of work proved in a physical cost model fix the computation graph with a random oracle, then apply pebbling.
  - The template is Blocki–Ren–Zhou: a random oracle, then red-blue pebbling, then energy as a weighted sum of resources.
  - If any route needs SHA-512 as a random oracle, that goes beyond the stated trust base and is a claims question for Daniel. Flag it to the coordinator.
- **CRT (Ozaki Scheme II)** makes wide products cost linear in width, not ⌈w/8⌉².
  - LIT estimates CRT Strassen below naive near n ≈ 2^20 if ALU work is ignored.
  - On the H200 the ALU price keeps it above naive; on the RTX PRO 6000 only device memory does.
- **Miller (1975)** is the only n³ lower bound for matmul in a restricted model, and it comes from a rounding (stability) requirement.
- **FP8 semantics:** Hopper accumulates one group of 32 at width 14, and sm_120 one group of 32 at width 26. Both match the repository's pins.
- **Device-specific overhead (brief 4(e), now fixed):** the 1.47–1.55× plain INT8 is the RTX PRO 6000's. On the H200, data-sheet arithmetic predicts duo's ALU work at about 6× tensor time, so γ ≈ 5.

**For you:** Honest Dither on the H200 with duo may already be at γ ≈ 5 before any hashing. Budget the fold and the hashing together against γ ≤ 10.
