# The actual circuit's guarantees

The model of `note:console/20261012T0645Z-draft-actual-circuit-model` (`Security/Definitions/Accounting/Actual.lean`):

* `Actual/Split.lean`: what a region reads from outside itself is what its location carried in plus what crossed its
  boundary.
* `Actual/Physical.lean`: causality at any latency makes wires run forward in time inside every location; under
  `Links`, ingress and egress are at most `β_X` a tick; compute rate at a pricing of at least one per gate bounds the
  gates.
