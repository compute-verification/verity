/-! The recursion as a compiler, generic in the outer argument and the server, over inner protocols with repetition
extractors: its statements (`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.Statement`), the Flock instance's
(`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.AtFlock`), with its plans' reads by Wald's bound (`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.PlansProof`), its
plans at its own runs as its finders (`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.AtFlockPlans`), its server as the bound record's
(`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.AtFlockServer`), and its well-formedness, its inner KS, its outer extraction's KS from each session's and its last-coin
hypothesis at the deployment proved (`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.AtFlockProof`), and the bridge to the sampled compiler (`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.Sampled`,
B1), with B1's proof and the recursive audit from L1 (`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.SampledProof`), and a toy outer argument
and compiler at which L2's hypotheses are stated to hold together (`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.Toy`), proved to hold
(`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.ToyProof`). L1's proof: the
compiled verifier's runs at any server (`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.ServerRun`) and the plurality prover on the
composition, which bounds the inner stage's failure where every outer extraction succeeds
(`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.Plurality`), its aborting runs as the composite's reruns
(`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.Coupling`), and the inner protocol's run finders at those runs read at the reruns
(`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.Lift`), the plurality prover's bad draws bounded by the link
(`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.BadDev`), and L1 with the recursive audit from it (`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.StatementProof`).
`E_O`'s knowledge soundness from the outer argument's (O1), and L2 from L1 and O1
(`Proofs.Flock.RecGeneric.OuterProof`). -/
