# Populations: which object each policy needs of sampled proofs' guarantee

`Determinacy`: robust determinacy and the downstream cone from single assignment and acyclicity, and the honest
evaluation. `Necessity`: determinacy for every choice of unit functions holds exactly when the checker's two checks do.
`Egress`: the egress is a function of the wrong units' writes when the secrets lie outside its upstream cone, so it takes
at most `(∑_{j ≤ m} C(n, j)) · |V| ^ (m w)` values; the location term and acyclicity are each needed.
