# The network period check's bound: what its `K` counts in each form (`NetworkCheck.Period`)

On acceptance, `NetworkCheck.Period.check` publishes `K`, the sum of a ceiling of `log2` of each factor of
`NetTiming.Guarantees.PeriodLeakAccepted`'s count at the number the check reads for it: `terms`'s in the clock form,
`rowsTerms`'s in the rows form. A sum of ceilings is at least the ceiling of the sum, so `K` is at least `⌈log2⌉` of
the count, not equal to it; `ClockKBoundsCount` and `RowsKBoundsCount` say the count at the check's numbers is at most
`2 ^ K`. `Proofs.Properties.NetworkPeriod` proves both.

The count is the statement's, factor by factor, over the network certifier's `m` connections and the period's `n`
windows: `#Ss · ((∏_c (cap_c + 1)) · ∏_i (2^#(free inputs) · #faultySets · 2^β · Dj^k))`. A reader of `K` (the
communication audit's bridge to `PeriodLeakAccepted`) instantiates it at the run's caps and the windows' facts, and
supplies each of the statement's quantities as at most the check's number:

- in the clock form the windows are the compute audits: `#Ss ≤ #Σ_sync ^ (link-windows)` (each link-window under one
  sync of Σ_sync), an audit's free inputs at most its layout's (`free`), its faulty sets at most the sets of at most `b`
  of its `N` units, `β` at most `b · bits` with `bits` the most one of its Program's units commits (`faulty_bits`), and
  `Dj^k` at most `jitter ^ steps`;
- in the rows form the windows are the link-windows' scans: `#Ss ≤ ∏_c (cap_c + 1)` (a schedule is its lanes'
  lengths), a window's free inputs at most its scan's Program's and its tied audits' (`free`: the egress renders the
  outputs of the audits its scan's `prog` is tied to, so the bits the prover chose of their inputs are the window's),
  each window's faulty sets at most the sets of at most `b` of its `N` units, `β` at most `b · max(b_ing, b_eg)`
  (`faulty_bits`) and, when a tied audit is sampled in part with a bound of at least one incorrect proof block, every
  slot entry bit (`faulty_entries`, `E_w`), and `Dj^k` at most `jitter ^ steps`.

The rows form's terms charge a tied audit (one a scan's `prog` is an output of) its free inputs, and its incorrect
proof blocks only as the slot entries they can set, since the scan reads the audit only through its `prog` and its
state is the scan's own. The check accepts a tied audit at any sample; the consistency check of one is `RowsProgWired`
and `RowsStateTied`. `RowsProgWired` says it accepts no link-window whose scan's `prog` is not a compute audit's slot
entries, a lane's tree the entries port of its chunk of an entry template of that audit's own Program at the closure
digest its circuit record registers, a record its registration binds. It reads the entry templates from what the
integration registered, over any registration: no constant of the check names a model, a template or a binding.
`RowsStateTied` says it accepts no link-window whose scan's state is not the `SCAN_STATE` of an audit its `prog` is
wired to, so a state that skips or alters one of the scan's transitions is no Program's input. Each says its
conclusion (`RowsProgWiredAt`, `RowsStateTiedAt`) of every period `check` accepts, and so is, by definition, its
property of any period check at `check` (`RowsProgWiredOf`, `RowsStateTiedOf`), which the nontrivial lemmas state
false at `acceptAllRows`, a check that accepts every period. Each guarantee writes its acceptance of `check` out rather
than being its `…Of check`: the shape rule reads the acceptance off the statement's own binders.

of a template node of that audit's own Program that its circuit record registers as an entry template, at the closure

registration binds before any coin (`Audit.boundIn`), with one member a slot of the window (`wired`), so chunk `j` is
