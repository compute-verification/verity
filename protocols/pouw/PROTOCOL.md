# Proof of useful work

Certifies that a declared workload of integer or FP8 matmuls was computed with at least a stated fraction of the honest
work, by sampled recomputation of committed checked values. The setting and the cost model (W1 on an RTX 4090) are the
PoUW problem statement's; the guarantee is Lean's `Pouw.Proofs.endToEnd` instantiated with a scheme's conjecture.

## The interface

A scheme (`protocol.PoUWScheme`) is a named, versioned object, looked up by name (`schemes.get`), with pinned vectors under
`tests/vectors`, like `verity.commitments.scheme.CommitmentScheme`. It turns one declared matmul's committed operand
rows into, for each tile, checked values, a transcript leaf and the useful output. It exposes:

- `name` and `certificate`: what an accepted audit rests on (the conjecture's claim id, γ_0, Ω*, the pinned Lean theorems,
  the hypotheses, the allowances);
- `check(matmul)`: refuses a declaration outside the domain, before any work;
- `tiles(shape)`: the checked units, a partition of the output cells; a tile is rows of A times rows of B at full k;
- `wref(shape)`: the honest reference's W1 cost, from the layout only;
- `noise(ctx)`: the matmul's hash-derived values, from the salt, the declaration and the committed roots;
- `encode(ctx, noise, a_rows, b_rows, tile)`: the checked product's operands for a tile, from its strips, or nothing when a
  row is malformed;
- `admissible(ctx, ops)`: the input policy (worst-case-input schemes accept every well-formed tile);
- `checked(ctx, ops)`, `digest(ctx, noise, checked)`, `useful(ctx, noise, ops, checked)`.

Operands are committed as rows along k: A is m × k and the weight B is committed as its n rows, so the product is A·Bᵀ.
Everything else is the protocol's (`audit`), the same for every scheme.

## Lifecycle (`audit`)

1. **Weights.** Each weight's rows are committed in a `verity.commitments.merkle` tree bound to the weight id (owner −2);
   `weights_root` binds every weight root.
2. **Salt.** `derive(beacon, "verity/pouw/salt/v1", {"weights": weights_root})`, drawn after the weights, 32 bytes.
3. **Units.** For each matmul (a 64-bit index, a shape, a weight id), the activation rows are committed bound to the salt
   and the index. The scheme derives its noise from (salt, matmul, roots); every tile yields checked values and a digest.
   The useful output is assembled from the tiles.
4. **Transcript.** A tree over every tile's digest, in matmul order then tile order, bound to (salt, weights_root).
5. **Selection.**
   - `Sampled(t)`, the default: `derive(source, "verity/pouw/audit/v1", {"transcript": root, "salt": salt})`; draw j is
     `key.uniform(W, j)` mapped to a tile by cumulative work, so t tiles are drawn independently, each with probability
     W_ref(tile)/W, a tile's work being its cells' share of its matmul's W_ref (Lean `WorkWeightedSampling`).
   - `Lottery(target)`, Pearl's mining rule: the tiles whose digest, read little-endian, is at most target·|rows|·|cols|·k.
6. **Check.** For each selected tile the prover opens A's rows, B's rows and the leaf. The verifier checks the openings,
   recomputes the tile through the scheme (`encode`, `admissible`, `checked`, `digest`) and compares the leaf.
7. **Profile.** When every selected tile passes, `WorkProfile`: for every ε_s in (0, 1] and every operator whose online cost
   is at most T, `Pr[accept ∧ T < (1 − γ)(1 − ε_s)·W] ≤ (1 − ε_s)^t + η` (Lean `endToEnd`), with γ = 1 − (1 − γ_0)/Ω*,
   under the certificate's conjecture. A scheme with no γ_0 gets only the sampling half; a lottery gets neither.

**Randomness.** The protocol owns the outer coins: the salt (from a beacon round) and the draw (from the verifier's source,
never the prover's root). A scheme's noise is its own derivation from the salt and the prover's roots, Fiat-Shamir inside
the scheme, whose grinding is inside the conjecture's error term.

- **P.** `ncp-v1` uses the word-granular production P: a SHAKE256 Fisher-Yates over the k/4 aligned words from seed
  `pous-pouw-ncp-Pword-v1`, then the deterministic repair (seed + `/repair`) so that no word lands in its own 16-step; the
  order inside each word is kept and every sign is +1. At k = 4,096 its SHA-256 (entries as 2-byte little-endian
  integers) is `24e68f30…`, the P the research coordinator certified. It must pass the rejection rule (Lean `Admissible`,
  checked at every k) and checkpoint independence (the fingerprint rank, per k; not in Lean).
  `ncp-v1-shift24` uses the shift by 24 instead, admissible with independent checkpoints for every k ≥ 1,024 with
  16 ∣ k (Lean `shiftBy24_admissible`, `independentWitness`).
- **Lean.** Proved: the barrier (`Pouw.Barrier.Proofs.generic`), the algebra (`Pouw.NCP.Proofs.cancel`, `stacked`,
  `wrap`, `range`), the reduction to TT_NCP (`Pouw.NCP.GameProofs.gammaFromTTNCP`), the chain to the checked values
  (`Pouw.NCP.ChainProofs.int7Int32`, `wrapFinalOnlyInd`), the restricted-model floor (`ncpWordFloorInd`) and the generic
  game (`theorem1`, `workWeightedSampling`, `endToEnd`). Assumed: TT_NCP(0.5%). Not proved: that M_4090 runs H_ref within
  `wref` (`AdmitsRef`), and the byte-level noise expansion here (the Lean takes any expansion of H's answers with the
  stated ranges).

## `pearl-fp8-v4`: Pearl's FP8 scheme (`schemes/pearl_kw.py`)

Pearl's certificate-v4 FP8 scheme, as published: the whitepaper "Pearl Floating Point Scheme Specification" (Sep 2026)
and pearl-research-labs/pearl PR #311 at `284b147b`, whose verifier code rules where the two differ. The module's
docstring states every parameter.

- **Conformance.** `tests/vectors/pearl_kw.json` holds Pearl's own outputs, computed by its Rust at `284b147b` from
  inputs `tests/pearl_vectors.py` derives; the generator is `tests/pearl_vectors.rs`. For both of Pearl's devices, H100
  and B200, the reference reproduces:
  - the labelled hashes, the noise lines and the BF16 operations;
  - the device matmul and its partials;
  - the census (λ, the grid, the skip);
  - the lane layout;
  - on whole 16 × 16 tiles at k = 1,024: the FP10 norms, the noise, the quantized codes and the per-row scales, the
    accumulator, the extract, J, and the jackpot policy's verdict (one tile approved, one rejected for dead entries).
- **The RTX 4090.** Pearl's whitelist has no Ada device, so `ada` is ours: Verity's pinned `sm89.mma.m16n8k32.e4m3`
  atom (`verity.ml.tc`), with H100's structure (a fresh accumulator every 128 products, promoted by one FP32 add), δ = 1
  and W = 13. With plain chained `mma.sync` instead, the 14-bit adder anchored at the running sum fails Pearl's
  unpredictable-summands census on honest inputs.
- **What the protocol replaces.** The chain headers become the salt. The activation and weight roots stand in for
  Pearl's keyed-BLAKE3 Merkle openings. The seed order is kept.
- **The conjecture.** Pearl's Assumption 1 with the jackpot policy. It names no γ_0, so the profile carries only the
  sampling half and the policy's allowances (5% skippable summands, 1/64 dead entries per side, the unchecked peel).
- **Its differences from milestone 1's D1**, the hardened KW transcript: see the module docstring.
