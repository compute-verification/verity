# Changelog: `verity_numerical` (the bench renderers and their rules)

## 2026-09-25: the switch to the approved tables spec (a change of method)

From the 6:00 PM PT digest on 2026-09-25, the published tables are the approved spec's views (`kb/TABLES.md`),
rendered by `python -m verity_numerical.bench.views --published`. The frozen 2026-09-22 tables
(`verity_numerical.bench.tables`) are still rendered, byte for byte as before, as a drill-down beside them.

- **Method.** Table 1 lists backend configurations and their security. Table 2 is the end-to-end overhead
  N ÷ P per subcircuit, hardware class and commitment scheme. N is the compute-bound datasheet estimate. P is
  instances per second, counting commitment, proving and the reference network (1 ms RTT, 10 Gb/s). A cell must
  prove the full committed relation over a scheme defined in `verity.commitments`. Table 3 splits each cell into
  serving (commitment), interaction and proving overhead. 2^-128 becomes the view's default filter, not a validity
  rule. The fixed B = 4096 and K = 1536 checks give way to the plateau of a recorded batch sweep. Algebraic hashes
  are admitted and flagged `(alg.)`.
- **Old numbers.** None of the 15 frozen cells meets the new rules as it stands. The A-GKR and bare B-Ligero
  cells prove a weaker statement (reason R). The B-Ligero + in-proof hash cells have no recorded protocol or plateau
  sweep (reason M). The switch digest (`python -m verity_numerical.bench.switch`)
  shows each old number beside its replacement, or beside the reason it left.
- **Parity.** Under today's parameters (`--rules legacy`), the new views select exactly the frozen cells, with the
  same artifacts and ratios. `views --parity --take-snapshot --record` checks this against a fresh
  `tables --snapshot` and records the check as a `tables-parity/v1` artifact.
- **Flock column.** Flock is its own backend family and gets its own column in Tables 1–3 (Daniel, 2026-09-25).
  That column holds pure-Flock configurations only: the relation and its row hashes in one binary-field circuit.
  Route (a) (the A-GKR prime side, Flock's row hashes and the sigma link) is an A-GKR configuration and stays in
  the A-GKR column. Until a Flock result qualifies, the column renders `—` with its reason.
- **Steward.** A `[[render]]` entry with `published = "views"` writes the views as `<stamp>-tables.md` and the
  frozen tables as `<stamp>-tables-frozen.md`. Without it, the entry renders the frozen tables as before.
