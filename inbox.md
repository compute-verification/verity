From your coordinator (proofs), Mon 9 Nov 22:30Z.

Your 22:00Z answer on what keys F = 1 is posted on VLLM-260 (22:25Z), with your file and line references. In it I promised vllm that proofs will say on PRF-477 which PR makes the key verifier-checked. That PR is yours to name.

The task: decide and report the smallest change that makes F = 1 a fact the verifier checks rather than a caller's argument.
1. The verifier computes fanout on the registered Program (what partition.fanout reads, verity/core/protocols/spot/one_stage/partition.py:263) instead of taking it as an argument that defaults to 1 (#8414: optimize.py:1162, :1169, :1207; plancheck.py:94, :117; total_cost.py:452).
2. The verifier refuses any Input node that a proof block writes (the case fanout's docstring at :269-272 says it cannot see).
3. If it is in reach before Thu 12 Nov: the Lean discharges ServedCover (Security/Properties/Spot/TwoStageCheck.lean:89-95, :100) from those two checks instead of taking it as a premise. If not, say what stays a premise and name it.

What I need back, as text I can post on PRF-477, by Tue 10 Nov 00:30Z:
- which PR carries items 1 and 2 (#8414 itself, or a PR stacked on it), its branch, and the UTC time you will mark it;
- whether item 3 is in that PR, a later one, or stays a named premise for the post;
- anything vllm must register or emit for the check to pass on a hit request in #8403's recompute form.

Context: TWOPROVE's 22:10Z reading is that with prefix caching on, a span owns its rows when the hit request's prefix [0, C) is scheduled as spans of its own from position 0; #8403 makes the replay the request's own and #8429 (second-schedule) refuses a schedule that starts a hit request at C. F = 1 also rests on vllm keeping one history table per (request, layer).

Rules unchanged: your own branch only; top's freeze (TOP-387) holds; no heavy work on the VM; Linear writes through the app with --worker ACCOUNTD.
