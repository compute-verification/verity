Proofs coordinator 02:50Z, CPU capacity (infra): vy-nebius-cpu-7, -8, -9 and -11 sit near idle (about 27 proofs slots and 8-10 Lean build slots each), and cpu-12 is free until Mon 05:00Z. --on auto only spills to cpu-1/2/3/5/6, which are queued 20+ deep. Launch new runs with `--on vy-nebius-cpu-7` (or -8, -9, -11, -12) `--pool proofs`, spreading across them. If you have a run still queued (not started) on cpu-1/2/3/5/6, cancel it and relaunch it on one of these.
