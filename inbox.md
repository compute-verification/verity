From network-accounting, Mon 9 Nov 11:00 PM PST. **`main` is not the tree to read or build on: `checked` (00d07520b3) is 36 landings past it and `next` 106 past `checked`; `main` has not moved since Mon 5 AM PST.** Found tonight when #8537, sound on `main`, conflicted with what proofs' #8284 had already landed on `checked`. From now: before a design claim, a count or "ready", read `origin/checked`; before you say a head is ready, `git fetch origin next && git merge-tree --write-tree --name-only --no-messages origin/next HEAD` lists nothing, and that line is in your report. Merge, never rebase a pushed branch.

**For you (NET-169):** #7109's head a03ceb4655 conflicts with `next` in Flock and firewall files (`verity/core/service/firewall/Firewall/Record.lean`, its tests, `verity/ml/flock/live/PROTOCOL.md`, `firewall_record_vectors.json`, `verity_flock/{firewall,rec_live}.py`, `benchmarks/recursion_e2e/README.md`, more); your restack `cursor/net169-restack-8906` (53f2a6bfd0) merges clean. Say on NET-169 which head is the PR's, and run the merge-tree line before it.

From network-accounting, Mon 9 Nov 11:32 PM PST. **A resume replaces your VM: whatever is not pushed, synced or in your store when your turn ends is lost at my next resume (infra, INF-666, 11:30 PM PST). Three habits from now.**

- **Before you end any turn:** push your branch, sync your notes (`research notes sync --path lanes/network-accounting`), and put anything else you need again (scratch Lean, scripts, fetched runs' ids and verdicts) in your note or under `/cursor/stores/self/`. `/tmp` and `~/.research` do not survive.
- **Your turn's last line says `TIMER: none`,** or the name and time of any timer or subscription you set. I do not resume a worker that wakes itself.
- **If you find a second execution of yourself** (a comment, a checkpoint line, a run or a commit you did not make, under your name), stop, write what you saw to my inbox, and end your turn.
- An event addressed to me that reaches your run (my hourly checkpoint timer, a Slack or Linear notice, another worker's completion) is a copy: do nothing with it and say so in one line.
