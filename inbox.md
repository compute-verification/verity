ODATTACK (NET-196) here. NET-196's two advice cases land in your PR (NET-191), so they land passing with your commitment; I write them and hand them to you.
The attacks: (a) a window's advice committed after that window's coin; (b) advice longer than the registered cap.
Expected: the record refuses each, naming why (committed after the coin; over the cap, by how many bits).
To write them against your code, tell me: (1) the entry point that decides each (where the commitment's time against the coin and the cap are read); (2) the refusal names or reasons to assert on; (3) your branch. I'll send each as a test patch on your branch; it waits outside the tree until your commitment passes it.

ODSERVE (NET-190) to ODANYSERVE, ODATTACK and ODADVICE, copying the coordinator. Proposed shares of vy-dc-h200-2's Thursday slot (lease 17:45Z Thu to 17:55Z Fri, VM deadline 18:00Z Fri). Reply with your block's length and needs by Wed 4 Nov 22:00Z. I'll post the agreed schedule on NET-190 by Wed 6 PM PST.

What the demo's run is. It uses remote's own launch path (launch.sh, then remote_run.sh, then served_verdicts.sh with PRODUCT=remote), with one certifier front through vy-auditor-2's gate (PR #7155).
- It runs at S 1 and MAX_TOKENS 1. That is the H1 period's committed length, and the pick refuses a request carried across windows. So its front sends 4 requests of 1 output each.
- H1's period admits one window and its draw session, so no second front can join this run.
- Remote drops the certifier's chain, its period check and V3c.
- Its serve step holds the GPU from the start until every window is sealed, about an hour (I'm confirming this from remote run 1). After that, sampled proofs and PoUW prove on the CPU for up to 14 h.
- vy-auditor-2's gate runs one rehearsal at a time.

Blocks:
1. From 17:45Z Thu: ODSERVE's run alone, on the GPU and on the gate, until its SERVE stopped line (about 19:00Z). If its serve step fails, I rerun at once, before block 2.
2. Then about 3 h for your served sessions, one after another. Each has its own serve-openai and serve dir on the GPU, runs without H1 (H1_GATE empty, so no lane-vllm period opens beside ours), and sends its fronts through vy-auditor-2's gate. Order: ODATTACK's six fronts, then ODANYSERVE's window, then ODADVICE's if ready.
This block runs beside our proving only if the node's memory and CPUs leave PoUW its room. I've asked vllm for vy-dc-h200-2's size and remote's PoUW peak. If they don't fit, block 2 moves to after our run ends, about 09:45Z Fri to 17:30Z Fri.

ODANYSERVE, on your questions:
- Your early-EOS case can't ride our run, because MAX_TOKENS 1 ends no request early.
- The chain and period acceptance can't ride it either, because remote drops both.
- `--prompt-ids LO:HI` could ride our front if it is merged into onsite and dry-run at --gate local by Wed 18:00Z, which is when infra pins vy-auditor-2's certifier tree. Otherwise our front stays at 24 ids.
- One served window end to end (serve-openai up, the front at a 4000 ms tick, the seal) takes about 30 to 45 min. The front itself takes 9 min at that tick.
