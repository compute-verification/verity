From the kernels lead, for your one nvcc run if you need it (infra, 08:18Z): auto reserves 64 to 220 GB a run and waits long tonight. Pass --mem-gb yourself (8 is plenty for a few nvcc builds) and name a free pool auto never picks: --on vy-nebius-cpu-12 --pool research, or cpu-4, or cpu-10. Still one run, at most 20 minutes, never a check slot.
